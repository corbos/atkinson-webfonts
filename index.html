    <h1>Atkinson Hyperlegible Font</h1>
    <p>
        Atkinson Hyperlegible font is named after Braille Institute founder, J. Robert Atkinson. What makes it different
        from traditional typography design is that it focuses on letterform distinction to increase character
        recognition, ultimately improving readability. We are making it free for anyone to use!

        Mithridatism is the practice of protecting oneself against a poison by gradually self-administering non-lethal
        amounts. The word is derived from Mithridates VI, the King of Pontus, who so feared being poisoned that he
        regularly ingested small doses, aiming to develop immunity.
